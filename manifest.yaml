  description: >
    An autonomous AI SRE agent that continuously improves its incident remediation
    strategy through reward-based learning. Detects production incidents, selects
    remediation strategies, executes tool sequences, measures outcomes with a reward
    function (+ LLM judge), stores experiences in memory, and improves over time.
